Owner Libby Billings opened The Vault in September of 2012. The Vault resides in the Iconic Mid Century Modern building that was originally built to house the First National Auto Bank built from 1958-1959. At the time it was the world’s largest auto bank with 6 drive through lanes. The bank had a private conference room named the Tom Tom room that was said to have held over 350 meetings a year. The Tom Tom room still exists today and now serves as a gathering place for Tulsans, a night time hang out, over flow dining, and a private dining room.

Today The Vault is excited to serve classic American food and craft cocktails in a building like no other. The Vault focuses on quality food made from scratch and always using organic or all natural meats as well as fresh vegetables and fruit. The craft cocktails are made to order using house squeezed juices, house made syrups and fine quality spirits.

When you can’t find Libby at The Vault you will likely find her just down the street at 5th and Boston at her other Restaurant Elote Cafe & Catering: elotetulsa.com

Libby Billings serves on the board of the Tulsa Regional Chamber of Commerce and the Tulsa Young Professionals Foundation. Libby is also the President of The Deco District Business Association and the President Elect for the Downtown Coordinating Council.
